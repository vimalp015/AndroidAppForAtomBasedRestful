First screen displays a list of eSports the user can choose from. 

In the second screen user can choose from a list of entries for the earliest selected eSport. This will take the user to a screen where details will be displayed. 

I have used Android Asynchronous Http Client for Http requests– An asynchronous callback-based Http client for Android built on top of Apache’s HttpClient libraries which is used by Pinterest, Instagram etc.,.
